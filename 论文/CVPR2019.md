## Efficient High-Dimensional, Edge-Aware Filtering

Most edge-aware techniques perform filtering through an explicit or implicit linear combination of the colors in the input pixels.  

The relationship between edge-aware filtering and high-dimensional spaces is made rigorous by the geometric interpretation of images as embedded surfaces.
