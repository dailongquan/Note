## Efficient High-Dimensional, Edge-Aware Filtering

Most edge-aware techniques perform filtering through an explicit or implicit linear combination of the colors in the input pixels.  

The relationship between edge-aware filtering and high-dimensional spaces is made rigorous by the geometric interpretation of images as embedded surfaces.

## Local Mode Filtering

Linear filters have two major drawbacks. First, edges in the image are smoothed with increasing filter size. Second, by extending the filters to multi-channel data, correlation between the channels is lost.

## Co-Occurrence Filter

That is, edges within texture should be ignored while edges that serve as boundaries between textures should be marked. 

Our goal is to design a boundary preserving filter that will smooth edges within a textured region and not across texture boundaries.
