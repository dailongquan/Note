# 1. Building the System

### 1.1 Requirements

PangaeaTracking has been tested in Ubuntu 14.04 only. Several 3rd party libraries are needed for compiling PangaeaTracking.

  - OpenGL / GLU / GLEW / X11 / TBB / LMDB / HDF5
```
   sudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-dev
   sudo apt-get install libglu1-mesa-dev
   sudo apt-get install libglew1.8 libglew-dev
   sudo apt-get install libx11-dev
   sudo apt-get install libtbb-dev
   sudo apt-get install liblmdb-dev
   sudo apt-get install libhdf5-serial-dev
```
  - OPENCV (e.g. version 2.4.8 or later)
    available at http://opencv.org/

  - Ceres Solver
    available at http://ceres-solver.org/

  - wxWidgets
    available at https://www.wxwidgets.org/

  - Boost
    available at http://www.boost.org/

### 1.2 Build Process

  To compile the system, do the following:

```
  ./build.sh
```

# 2. Data

One example sequence is available at [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B8-9V4y1N7pxZExaMlE3bnc3Mzg).
Download the data and unzip data/Yiwan/yiwan.tar.

# 3. Examples

After building PangaeaTracking and preparing the data, you are ready to run the scripts in examples folder.
Check examples/Yiwan.sh for usage.

# 4. GUI Usage

For rotating the 3d model in 2d image plane, use the middle mouse button.
